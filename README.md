# MQTT N8N Conversation Agent for Home Assistant

A custom [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) integration that allows you to use **n8n + Ollama** as a **conversation agent**, with **streamed replies via MQTT**.

This component enables HA to offload conversation processing to `n8n` (which in turn can call [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)) via MQTT message passing.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- ðŸ”„ MQTT-based communication between Home Assistant and n8n
- ðŸ“¡ Streaming response support

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. Home Assistant sends user input to MQTT (`n8n/voice/input/<conversation_id>`)
2. n8n listens to that topic and processes the message:
   - Uses [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) via HTTP API or Docker socket
   - Publishes streaming responses to `n8n/voice/output/<conversation_id>`
3. Home Assistant subscribes to the output topic, assembles the reply, and displays it to the user
